# ArcVault2.0 -- Quick Reference
**Last updated:** May 22, 2026 | **v1.0.0** | **PRODUCTION READY**

## Status
✅ Phase 12: Failure notifications (webhook + email)  
✅ Phase 13: Scheduled backup templates (cron-based job automation)  
✅ Phase 14: Agent update system & rollback  
✅ Phase 15 (backend): RBAC with JWT authentication, user management, agent groups  
✅ Phase 15 (frontend): Login, useAuth composable, user/group CRUD, smart job forms  
✅ Phase 16 (backend): Federation failover, state sync (federation_events log), health monitoring  
✅ Phase 16 (frontend): FederationHealth.vue dashboard with auto-refresh  
✅ Phase 16 (agent): Coordinator list failover with exponential backoff  
✅ Phase 16 (gaps): Agent homing persisted, heartbeat detector live, stale banners wired to lag composable  
✅ Phase 17 (COMPLETE): Enhanced monitoring & alerting
  - Job start time accuracy fix (recorded in job_runs table)
  - Alert rules engine (per-job configurable rules: on_failure, duration_exceeded, missed_schedule)
  - Webhook retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts: 5s → 15s → 45s)
  - Slack & Teams notifiers (via incoming webhooks)
  - Alert history tracking (30-day retention by default)
  - Scheduler: Missed schedule detector + history pruning
  - Frontend: Alerts.vue dashboard with rule creation/deletion & retry controls  
✅ All tests passing | v1.0.0 released on GitHub  
🎯 Next: Deploy to production, configure alert rules

## Core Commands
```bash
# Initialize coordinator
coordinator init

# Start coordinator (runs dashboard on :8080)
coordinator start

# Generate per-agent token
coordinator create-agent-token <agent-id>

# Check for updates
coordinator check-update

# Install as system service
coordinator install-service
agent install-service
```

## What's Implemented
- ✅ Single binary deployment (coordinator) with embedded Vue dashboard
- ✅ Per-agent tokens (in addition to admin token)
- ✅ Self-update system (coordinator + agents, live WebSocket progress)
- ✅ Bidirectional rollback (one-version-back, v0.3.0+)
- ✅ Server-side pagination & filtering (all list endpoints)
- ✅ Job history visualization (timeline + agent charts, v0.4.0+)
- ✅ Failure notifications (webhook + email, v0.5.0+)
- ✅ JWT-based RBAC (v0.8.0): Three roles (admin, operator, viewer) with fine-grained endpoint access
- ✅ User management: Create/list/delete/update roles with bcrypt password hashing
- ✅ Agent groups: Organize agents by environment or function, assign members

## Quick Setup

**Per-agent token:**
```bash
coordinator create-agent-token agent-01
# Copy token to agent-config.yaml as auth_token
```

**Notification config** (`coordinator/config.json`):
```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "on_failure": true,
    "webhook": {
      "url": "https://hooks.example.com/arcvault",
      "secret": "hmac-secret"
    },
    "email": {
      "smtp_host": "smtp.example.com",
      "smtp_port": 587,
      "from": "arcvault@example.com",
      "to": ["ops@example.com"],
      "username": "user",
      "password": "pass"
    }
  }
}
```
*Both webhook and email optional; webhook uses GitHub convention: `X-ArcVault-Signature: sha256=<hex>`*

**Service installation:**
```bash
# Windows (admin PowerShell)
coordinator install-service
sc start arcvault-coordinator

# Linux/macOS (root)
sudo coordinator install-service
sudo systemctl start arcvault-coordinator        # Linux
sudo launchctl start com.arcvault.coordinator   # macOS
```
